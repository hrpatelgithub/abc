If there's no guarantee about the order, then the docs should say that. What I've observed is that dataframe `value_counts` sorts by values when `sort=False`, while dataframe value_counts sorts by the order that the keys first appeared in the data. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(['b', 'a', 'a'])\\r\\n# dataframe sorts by values, so index is [a, b]\\r\\nprint(df.value_counts(sort=False))\\r\\n# dataframe sorts by order of row where each value first appears, so index is [b, a]\\r\\nprint(df[0].value_counts(sort=False))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\r\\n\\r\\nExplain what order to expect, if any, when `sort=False`.\",\n",

Because it is a \"local\" hook, we now have two \"local\" sections, but that _seems_ to work fine. \\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas\\r\\n\\r\\npandas_df = pandas.DataFrame([\"asd\"])\\r\\nprint(pandas_df.dtypes)\\r\\n# 0    object\\r\\n# dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\npandas_df2 = pandas.DataFrame([1])\\r\\nprint(pandas_df2.dtypes)\\r\\n# 0    int64\\r\\n# dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\npandas_df3 = pandas.concat([pandas_df, pandas_df2], axis=0)\\r\\nprint(pandas_df3.dtypes)\\r\\n# 0    object\\r\\n# dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(pandas_df3[0].str.split())\\r\\n# 0    [asd]\\r\\n# 0      NaN\\r\\n# Name: 0, dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(pandas_df[0].str.split())\\r\\n# 0    [asd]\\r\\n# Name: 0, dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(pandas_df2.astype(\"string\")[0].str.split())\\r\\n# 0    [1]\\r\\n# Name: 0, dtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(pandas_df2.astype(\"object\")[0].str.split())\\r\\nAttributeError: Can only use .str accessor with string values!\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nIt seems that there is some inconsistency when calling `str.split`. `pandas_df3` has `object` dtype and when calling `str.split` it returns `NaN` for `1` value. However, when we convert `pandas_df`, which has `int` dtype, to `string`, when calling `str.split` it returns `[1]` for `1` value. And also, when we convert `pandas_df`, which has `int` dtype, to `object` as `pandas_df` has, when calling `str.split` it raises the error. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIt seems that only what `print(pandas_df2.astype(\"string\")[0].str.split())` returns would be the right behavior.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\npandas : 1.5.3\\r\\nnumpy : 1.24.1\\r\\npytz : 2022.7.1\\r\\ndateutil : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools : 66.1.1\\r\\npip : 22.3.1\\r\\nCython : None\\r\\npytest : 7.2.1\\r\\nhypothesis : None\\r\\nsphinx : 6.1.3\\r\\nblosc : None\\r\\nfeather : 0.4.1\\r\\nxlsxwriter : None\\r\\nlxml.etree : 4.9.2\\r\\nhtml5lib : None\\r\\npymysql : None\\r\\npsycopg2 : 2.9.3\\r\\njinja2 : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython : 8.8.0\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4 : 4.11.1\\r\\nbottleneck : None\\r\\nbrotli :\\r\\nfastparquet : 2022.12.0\\r\\nfsspec : 2023.1.0\\r\\ngcsfs : None\\r\\nmatplotlib : 3.6.3\\r\\nnumba : None\\r\\nnumexpr : 2.8.3\\r\\nodfpy : None\\r\\nopenpyxl : 3.0.10\\r\\npandas_gbq : 0.15.0\\r\\npyarrow : 10.0.1\\r\\npyreadstat : None\\r\\npyxlsb : None\\r\\ns3fs : 2023.1.0\\r\\nscipy : 1.10.0\\r\\nsnappy : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy : 1.4.46\\r\\ntables : 3.7.0\\r\\ntabulate : None\\r\\nxarray : 2023.1.0\\r\\nxlrd : 2.0.1\\r\\nxlwt : None\\r\\nzstandard : None\\r\\ntzdata : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
